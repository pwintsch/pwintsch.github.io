= Welcome to the fool's voyage in the world of 8bit emulation and basic interpreters

A blow by blow account of my futile attemps at emulating the computers, consoles and arcades I grew up with. Done for no other reason than to see if I can. If it helps others along the way, then that's a bonus!

== Introduction

So I am not really starting from scratch, I have previous !!!

Since late 2019 i have been writing code off and on around these subjects.

It started with the Cult of the bound Variable. (http://www.boundvariable.org/task.shtml). The first part of which was to write an emulator for a weird pre-historic computer.
